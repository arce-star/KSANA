# KSANA

ksana是梵语中的一个词, 意思是"一瞬间"或"片刻", 从佛教传入中国, 到众多佛教经典陆续被翻译为中文, 一些蕴含外来智慧的词语诞生, 再到这些中文的佛教经典从士大夫群体走向普罗大众的生活, 这些代表着佛学智慧的词语才逐渐融入我们的生活, 成为中华文化的底色之一

> ksana is a Sanskrit word meaning "a moment", from the introduction of Buddhism into China, to the many Buddhist classics have been translated into Chinese, the birth of some words containing foreign wisdom, and then these Chinese Buddhist classics from the scholars to the lives of the general public, these words representing the wisdom of Buddhism gradually integrated into our lives, and has become one of the undertones of Chinese culture.

## 设想

创造文字和词语, 成为文化的一部分  

文字是文化的载体, 而文字本身也可以拓展文化, 外来的文化融入本土文化, 只有在形成了全新的文字并且被普罗大众广泛使用后才代表着文化的进一步迭代. 比如佛教对中国文化的汇入, 在佛教传入中国的时期开始, 本土的有智慧的高人将佛学典籍翻译为中文, 再到慧能法师将佛教从小众的士大夫圈子中改革到广大群众中, 直到那些蕴含佛教智慧和文化的词语在中国大众的生活中被使用, 佛教的文化才被真正的吸收进了中国本土文化当中, 成为当代中国文化的不可或缺的文化底色之一  

当今AI的能力日益发展, 许多以前做不到的事情成为可能. 中国的汉字历经数代更迭, 想要从最初的对现象的观察->思想的产生->希望将思想用文字来记录表达->创建一个象形文字->历经更迭->呈现出携带最初思想和智慧的文字->汇入当今文化->经过历史的沉淀成为文化的底色之一  

现在我们可以借助AI工具来模拟**从思想到象形文字并更迭到文字的过程**, 我认为这是非常有意义的, 因为文化来自于从古至今的普罗大众最朴素的思想, 文字携带的是人民的智慧, 我们也应该将文字的权力交给人民, 让每个人都有机会成为文化的创造者, 为这个流传千年的开源思想库添加自己的贡献  

> create word and be a part of culture

> Words are carriers of culture, and words themselves can expand culture. The integration of foreign cultures into the local culture only represents a further iteration of the culture when a completely new word is created and widely used by the general public. For example, in the period when Buddhism was introduced to China, local wise men translated Buddhist texts into Chinese, and then Venerable Hui Neng reformed Buddhism from a small circle of scholars to the general public, and it was not until those words containing Buddhist wisdom and culture were used by the general public that Buddhist culture was truly absorbed into the local Chinese culture, and became an indispensable cultural foundation of contemporary Chinese culture. One of the indispensable cultural colors of contemporary Chinese culture

> With the increasing power of AI, many things are possible that were not possible before. Chinese characters have changed through generations, from the first observation of phenomena -> the emergence of ideas -> the desire to express ideas in writing -> the creation of a hieroglyphic script -> through changes -> the presentation of words that carry the original ideas and wisdom -> into today's culture -> through the sedimentation of history to become one of the underlying colors of culture.

> Now we can use AI tools to simulate the process of **from thoughts to hieroglyphs and then iterated to words**, I think this is very meaningful, because culture comes from the most simple thoughts of the general public from ancient times to the present day, the words carry the wisdom of the people, we should also give the power of the words to the people, so that everyone has the opportunity to be the creators of culture, for the millenniums of open source thought bank Add your own contribution to this open source library of ideas that has been passed down for thousands of years.

## 落地实现

### 1. 创造文字

- User 产生一个对现象的观察或一段思考
- User 通过一段文字或者一张图画或者一个情景等等表现方式来告知AI自己的这个思想
- AI 通过分析这个思想给出一些最原始的象形文字供选择, 它们要能简明扼要的表达这个思想
- User 从中选择出比较符合自己心理预期的原始文字
- AI 根据汉字的迭代历史, 模拟这个文字的更迭过程, 直到产生最后的符合现代书写规则的文字

> - User generates an observation or a thought about a phenomenon.
> - The User informs the AI of his/her thought by means of a text or a picture or a scenario.
> - The AI analyzes the thought and gives a selection of primitive hieroglyphs that express the thought in a clear and concise way.
> - User selects the original characters that match his/her expectations.
> - AI simulates the iteration process according to the iteration history of Chinese characters, until it produces the final character that conforms to the modern writing rules.

### 2. 创造词语

重点在于将外在文化的精华部分转化到本土文化中并吸收结晶产生一些词语, 类似于外语佛教典籍传入国内直到全新的蕴含哲理和智慧的词语出现到大众生活的过程

> The focus is on transforming the best parts of the foreign culture into the local culture and absorbing and crystallizing them to produce words, similar to the process by which foreign-language Buddhist texts were introduced into the country until new philosophical and wise words appeared in the lives of the general public.
